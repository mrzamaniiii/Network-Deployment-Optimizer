# 📡 Network Deployment Optimizer

This project applies **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** to optimize the deployment of wireless cellular networks. It explores and compares **macro-only**, **micro-only**, and **mixed** base station configurations over a 1500m × 1500m area using realistic radio propagation and throughput models.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Optimization Objective**: Minimize total deployment cost while ensuring full coverage and required throughput.
- **Technology**: MILP (via Python), Okumura-Hata path loss model, Shannon capacity theorem.
- **Deployment Types**: Macro, Micro, and Mixed base stations.

## ⚙️ Mathematical Model

### 📌 Sets
- `C`: Candidate Sites (50)
- `T`: Test Points (100)
- `B`: Base Station Types = {macro, micro}

### 📌 Parameters
- `cost[c,b]`: Installation cost
- `coverage[c,t,b]`: Binary (0/1) signal coverage
- `throughput[c,t,b]`: Estimated Mbps throughput
- `min_thr`: Minimum throughput = 7 Mbps

### 📌 Decision Variables
- `install[c,b]`: Whether to install BS type `b` at site `c`
- `serve[c,t,b]`: Whether BS at `c` serves test point `t`

### 📌 Objective
Minimize total cost across selected deployments and assignments.

## 🗂️ Simulation Results

| Scenario     | Total Cost | Macro BS | Micro BS | Deployed Sites              |
|--------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Macro-only   | $9.24      | 4         | 0         | [24, 26, 39, 42]            |
| Micro-only   | $7.32      | 0         | 12        | [4, 6, 10, ..., 48]         |
| Mixed        | $6.77      | 1         | 9         | Macro: [26], Micro: [1,...] |

- ✅ 100% coverage in all scenarios
- ✅ All test points meet throughput requirement
- 📉 Mixed scenario achieves **lowest cost** with **balanced performance**
